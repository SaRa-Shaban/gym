  <!-- The second and third lines are preconnect links that establish a connection to external resources before they are actually needed. In this case, the links are connecting to Google Fonts, a web font service that provides a wide range of fonts that can be used on web pages. By establishing a connection to Google Fonts in advance, the browser can load the fonts more quickly when they are actually needed, improving the performance of the web page. The crossorigin attribute on the second link specifies that the resource may be loaded from another origin, which is necessary for security reasons when using certain types of web resources.
